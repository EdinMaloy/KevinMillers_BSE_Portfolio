# A Coded Car Robot Named Roombat
I am working on a simple coded Car robot. I gave the him name Roombat because he looks like a bat shaped roomba. Roombat also has he/him pronouns apparently. This is the end of the description now.

My first milestone was to actually build the freaking robot. I started with building the body, which was a whole process that took multiple days. It wasnt hard I just kept repeating mistakes. I finally got to wiring which also was a whole process, The wires were very small but fun to work with nevertheless. When I finally got to coding and this was the easiest part due to me using an arduino which is designed to make coding easy and the code i had to use was already on the computer ready to up load. My robot works and is able to move forward backward and spin around in that order.
